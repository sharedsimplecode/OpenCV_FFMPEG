# OpenCV FFMPEG

This simple code is extracted from my project to access the camera through RTSP using OpenCV library.
It should be noted that the OpenCV and ffmpeg are built with cuda enable. I use this module not only to speed the process but also to minimize the CPU usage since I need to access many RTSPs at the same time.

For building FFMPEG with cuda enable will be provided later

For building OpenCV with cuda enable will provided later.

## Requirements:
1. [OpenCV 4.5.0 with Cuda](OpenCV_with_CUDA_build.md)
2. [FFMPEG with Hardware Accelation](FFMPEG_BUILD.md)
